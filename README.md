# semantic-similarity
A program that finds similar words (synonyms) through computation and predictive algorithms taught from test data.
Given a list of word options, the program can determine the synonym of a word. The program is trained on two text files in the 'learn_data' folder in order to compute
the cosine similarity of any two given words. Then, this can be used to compare all available alternatives to determine which words are most likely to be synonyms.

This is a basic example of a machine learning process, which uses available data to train a decision-making model.
